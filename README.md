# Zaloha2_Snapshot.sh

Zaloha2_Snapshot is an add-on script to [Zaloha2](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha2.sh) to create hardlink-based snapshots
of the backup directory *(condition: hardlinks must be supported by the
underlying filesystem type)*.

This allows to create **Time Machine**-like backup solutions.

## Why a new repository and program name?

 * CSV data model has been extended between [Zaloha.sh](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha.sh) and [Zaloha2.sh](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha2.sh),
   making an upgrade from [Zaloha_Snapshot.sh](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha_Snapshot.sh) to [Zaloha2_Snapshot.sh](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha2_Snapshot.sh) necessary.
